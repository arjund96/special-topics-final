# special-topics-final

Given the duration of the exam and a slow computer, I was only able to create the new Queries
and do the server side of the exam. It took me long time to clone and commit the file due to it's 
large size.

I finished the queries in the client side and was testing them on GraphQL Playground. After doing 
all of this, I was left with only 30 minutes to show it to the UI. Due to this, I panicked and failed
to meet the basic requirements of showing the boats in the UI.

I request you to please be considerate of the unwanted events that happened with me during the exam.

Thank you.
